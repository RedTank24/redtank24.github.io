  <h1>About Me</h1>
 </div>
  <p>My name is Benjamin Schmaal.<br>
Currently studying Creative Technology at the University of Twente, I'm a curious person that always wants to produce high quality works.
I've dabbled in storywriting, art and programming as a hobby, hoping to make my own worlds, stories and games one day. <br><br>
Other skills such as game design, video editing and composition are within my reach, though I'm eager to add more to my skillset.
Whilst groupwork isn't my strongside — often opting to work alone instead — I try my best to be as good in every field as possible to bring forth a product of good quality.</p>
